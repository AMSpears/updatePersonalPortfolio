                  <p>Daisyâ€™s Wine shop is an e-commerce site I worked on at Grace Hopper. I used react.js in conjunction with redux.js to both create components that display, add, edit, and delete our products while communicating to our server to appropriately update the database.</p>
                  <p>I created an account management portal that included Google Oath authentication. In addition to user-facing account management, I created a page for admins to manage their online wine store. Admins could view users and add/edit/remove wines in their store.

            <p>Any user is able to view the products and add products to their cart. Only users with an account are able to proceed in the checkout process.
