                  <p>I get to see some of the worldâ€™s best art on the streets of the neighborhood in New York. I live near Bushwick, where street art thrives. Unfortunately, street art can be up for a moment and lost forever. I worked with a team a Grace Hopper to create a web app to capture and map the best street art around the world.</p>
                  <p>I used Mapbox in conjunction with react.js to display all artworks on a map that is center in new york city coordinates. I additionally added the view as a list functionality and gave users the ability to edit their artwork postings by updating or removing the posting.</p>
